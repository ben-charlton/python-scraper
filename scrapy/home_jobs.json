However we have 3 full time staff who never come in. We are a virtually a virtual firm, during Covid lockdowns we all work from home. Due to the wonders of Zoom, PEXA and other cloud based systems we are 100% paperless and all our work is done through Chrome.  \r\n  We only maintain offices so that our solicitors can have social interaction and get away from home when they have cabin fever. We have physical offices in Sydney's MLC building, Northbridge (NSW) and on the Sunshine Coast.  \r\n  We have weekly Zoom meetings and an annual boat party. We are very busy and looking for bright and ambitious solicitors to help us grow. You will be running your own cases and handling your own client portfolio within two years and within 3-4 years you will be on a six figure salary.  \r\n  Our 5 partners are leaders in their field and make top class mentors. We are open to solicitors who are interstate working 100% from home. Our flexible arrangements suit parents and students (we have three parents).  \r\n  Once you are up and running (around six months) in addition to your base we will also pay a percentage of your recovered fees to you as a bonus. This is calculated and paid weekly.  \r\n  This position would suit a law graduate, up to 4 year PQE or person returning to the law after a long hiatus. Your starting salary will be negotiated based on your experienced. The nature of our work is that there are plenty of things you can do with little or no skill (following our procedures manual and automated checklists), then as you progress you gradually absorb more and more of the law and a deeper understanding of what you are doing. This allows you to progress onto more complex and challenging work.  \r\n  The wand chooses the wizard and the lawyer chooses the firm\u2026"

You\u2019ll also understand the amount of non-billable hours and overhead expenses success requires in the industry.  And so do we.  \r\n Based in the heart of Sydney\u2019s CBD, we\u2019ve earned a reputation for our forward-thinking and dynamic approach to legal services. This position in the industry renders a level of respect on which we thrive and on which we work extensively to maintain - every single day. \r\n You know the deal, because as a practitioner running your own practice, you\u2019ve probably been burning the midnight oil to keep up with running a business as well as actually trying to complete the legal work you\u2019re billing for. \r\n Over the past year, we\u2019ve seen an increasing amount of legal professionals just like you \u201cstruggle to juggle\u201d. It sparked an idea which we\u2019ve brought to fruition. An evolution of the legal industry. What if you could actually shake the shackles of running your practice and just focus on being the exceptional lawyer you were meant to be?\u00a0 \r\n Lehman Walsh offers an alternative to running your own practice, without sacrificing your independence and ability to call the shots.\u00a0 \r\n  Freedom, Control & Flexibility  \r\n Our Consulting Principal model is a level up on running your own legal practice. Succinctly put - we provide the credibility of our brand, administrative services and a network of peers and you, well, you continue to work independently in your chosen legal specialty. \r\n Effectively you operate as an independent legal practitioner under the Lehman Walsh umbrella, secure in the knowledge that all the \u201coffice\u201d and admin is taken care of.\u00a0 \r\n You can probably already start to list the benefits yourself, but here are some you might want to consider: \r\n \r\n  Work remotely from wherever you are on the globe  \r\n \r\n You\u2019ve worked hard to achieve independence. Working as a Consulting Principal to Lehman Walsh Lawyers means you can retain this independence and base yourself wherever you work best. When you do need an impressive location for face to face meetings, you can access our offices in Sydney\u2019s MLC Building. \r\n \r\n  Unlimited access to the services of a large legal firm\u00a0  \r\n \r\n We provide you with a full service offering for your clients. Administrative support, essential collaboration with experienced colleagues, paralegal staff and all the services you require from your own law firm. \r\n \r\n  Working in an environment where your seniority attracts respect - not politics:  \r\n \r\n Remove office politics, unnecessary hierarchy and unreachable targets from your life. When you work in an environment free from inter-office drama and experience the drive of colleagues to achieve common success, you\u2019ll be surprised at the success you can attain! \u00a0 \r\n \r\n  Leverage the credibility of an established Law Firm to build your client base:  \r\n \r\n There is no doubt that working with a respected, large firm is a strong magnet both for new business and the ability to attract significant rates. Working as a Consulting Principal allows you to utilise our reputation in the industry to grow your business. \r\n \r\n  You set your own goals and take the majority of the billings\u00a0  \r\n \r\n Our Consulting Principals set their own goals. You\u2019ll no longer have to meet billing targets whilst sacrificing the majority of your billings to the firm. \r\n We believe, afterall, that  you  are doing the work, so  you  deserve the biggest share.\u00a0 \u00a0 \r\n \r\n  Set your own hours, choose your own clients and work on what makes you happy  \r\n \r\n You are in the driver\u2019s seat, supported by a team, a culture and a brand that is motivated by your success. \r\n Our vision is to grow a legal firm which recognises that the interests of clients are best served by bringing together Consulting Principals who work within a culture that supports collaboration, values quality and dispenses with ego. \r\n  You do you. And we\u2019ll look after the rest.  \r\n \u00a0What could this mean for me? \r\n Our Consulting Principals are all well supported, connected, and enjoy a flat rate service fee. Any charges to your clients in the first three months will be processed by Lehman Walsh at a 25% fee and following this at the rate of 30%.\u00a0 \r\n So, if you have your own client list, and consider yourself to be a self-managing professional who values their own time and career freedom, it\u2019s time to get in touch."

        "description": "We invite applications from law students for positions as cadet lawyers.  \r\n  This is a rare opportunity for students who are keen to acquire practical legal skills by working in a modern law firm.  \r\n These are permanent career positions with reduced and flexible working hours during university semesters to accommodate your studies on a reduced-load basis. They include annual leave, sick leave and superannuation calculated on a pro-rata basis.\u00a0They are not vacation clerkships; nor are they designed to offer temporary student employment.\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n We offer a high level of supervision, support and regular in-house training; however, we expect you to acquire practical skills quickly in your designated area of employment with a view to making a meaningful contribution. \r\n We encourage cadets to perform well academically and to participate to a reasonable degree in extra-curricular university activities.\u00a0 Our alumni include winners and finalists of the UWA Opening Mooting, Trial Advocacy and Negotiation competitions. In 2017 one of our members spent the year studying in Beijing and Hong Kong on a New Colombo Plan Scholarship. \r\n  What does the job entail?  \r\n You will be employed as a legal professional.\u00a0 \r\n You will start your career in our\u00a0 real estate settlements \u00a0workgroup. This area has a high volume of client files and well-established systems for delivering services. There you will learn our office procedures and how to use our legal practice management system\u00a0  ContactsLaw  . \r\n A mentor will monitor your progress and help you develop the skills you need to hit the ground running and operate as an effective member of our professional team. You will take charge of and manage client files from the outset.\u00a0 \r\n Additionally, we encourage all members of our team to participate in the management of the firm, for example, in marketing activities, software development, systems administration, or document management. \r\n The practical skills that you acquire should kick-start your career in law and place you well ahead of your peers professionally by the time that they graduate. \r\n  What we offer  \r\n \r\n You will be employed on a permanent basis subject to a six month probation period. \r\n You will be paid at the Legal Services Award rate, plus superannuation.\u00a0\u00a0 You will be entitled to annual leave and paid sick leave.\u00a0 You will be entitled to an average of 13 hours per week study leave during university semesters. \r\n Your performance and remuneration will be formally reviewed annually. We will pay you according to the value of your ability and contribution not your level of qualifications or years of experience. \r\n \r\n  What we're looking for  \r\n To be considered for these positions you will: \r\n \r\n be enrolled in a law course at a local university; \r\n have a strong ATAR, (or TER/TEE) score and above average university grades; \r\n be committed to a professional career as a lawyer in the private sector; \r\n be sufficiently self-disciplined to balance the competing demands of a responsible job, university studies and a personal life; \r\n keenly embrace technology as a means of enhancing the delivery of legal services; \r\n be a leader and a team player; and \r\n have a sense of humour. \r\n \r\n You must be prepared to work an average of 25 hours per week (although there is scope for flexibility depending on exam schedules etc) during university semesters and full-time during university holidays; and to reduce the level of your university commitments accordingly.\u00a0 You must accept that, in doing so,\u00a0 it will take longer to complete your degree .  \r\n You will benefit from our experience in helping cadets manage their work and study loads; however it requires considerable self-discipline on your part (eg studying on the weekends!). Our cadetships are demanding jobs that require a serious investment of time and energy. \r\n  A different kind of law firm  \r\n Although we have been in business for over 40 years, we strive to lead as a digital law firm and have embraced the NewLaw business model.\u00a0As part of this revolution, you will participate in enhancing our clients\u2019 experience. \r\n Find out more\u00a0 about us here . \r\n  FAQs  \r\n  What happens when I graduate?  \r\n We hope that you will remain with us for many years; if you are still with us by the time you graduate we would expect our relationship to continue uninterrupted. \r\n  And my holidays?  \r\n Consistent with our long-term approach to our relationships we will do our best to accommodate your need to see the world by negotiating extended leave arrangements in appropriate circumstances. \r\n  Will my career prospects be adversely affected if I delay completion of my degree?  \r\n As a cadet lawyer under our supervision you are able to undertake virtually all of the duties of an admitted lawyer except appearances in open court. The practical experience you will gain working in our professional environment will more than compensate you for the additional time it will take you to graduate.\u00a0 \r\n  Can I undertake Internships with other law firms?  \r\n Many firms offer students work experience in their offices as a possible prelude to employment.\u00a0 It is a term of your employment contract with us that you don\u2019t engage in any other form of employment and we don\u2019t see such internships as consistent with the positions that we are offering.\u00a0 We know that it\u2019s a tough call when you\u2019ve had little or no industry experience, but we\u2019re looking for people who have weighed the alternatives and worked out what environment is most likely to suit them. \r\n  More information  \r\n \r\n Talk to one of team: visit\u00a0  our team  \u00a0page for their direct telephone numbers. \r\n Read\u00a0 why we are here \u00a0and more about\u00a0 careers at Birman & Ride . \r\n Check out our websites \u2013\u00a0 Flat Rate Settlements ,\u00a0 Perth Wills Centre ,\u00a0 Perth Probate Centre ,\u00a0 Resolution Family Law ,\u00a0 Get Paid Debt Collection ,\u00a0 ContactsLaw  \r\n \r\n  How do I apply?  \r\n Applications must be made through our\u00a0 online form [click here] . \r\n  Application timetable  \r\n Applications close: 8 October 2021 \r\n Interviews: Week commencing 11 October 2021 \r\n  Before you apply  \r\n \r\n Critically review the above criteria. Is the job for you? Do you have what it takes? Have you discussed it with your partner? Your Dad? Or your dog? Are you prepared to reorganise your life to meet the demands of the position? \r\n Consider your existing study load and how you would restructure it if you take the job. We understand that you have to complete the university units you've enrolled in this semester, but you will need to undertake fewer units per semester in the future."

We have a very flat structure and the emphasis is to get you running your own matters (under supervision, of course) as soon as possible. Two of our partners are published legal academics. We are known throughout the industry as being highly competent due to our strong emphasise on the legal research and staff training. This makes you not only highly skilled very quickly but makes you eminently employable. Your practical legal education will continue as quickly as you can learn as our senior partners (who have been at the firm for 20 and 16 years respectively) delight in mentoring the next generation of top lawyers.  \r\n  Most solicitors in our firm work 3 days in the office and 2 days at home. However we have 3 full time staff who never come in. We are a virtually a virtual firm, during Covid lockdowns we all work from home. Due to the wonders of Zoom, PEXA and other cloud based systems we are 100% paperless and all our work is done through Chrome.  \r\n  We only maintain offices so that our solicitors can have social interaction and get away from home when they have cabin fever. We have physical offices in Sydney's MLC building, Northbridge (NSW) and on the Sunshine Coast.  \r\n  We have weekly Zoom meetings and an annual boat party. We are very busy and looking for bright and ambitious solicitors to help us grow. You will be running your own cases and handling your own client portfolio within two years and within 3-4 years you will be on a six figure salary.  \r\n  Our 5 partners are leaders in their field and make top class mentors. We are open to solicitors who are interstate working 100% from home. Our flexible arrangements suit parents and students (we have three parents).  \r\n  Once you are up and running (around six months) in addition to your base we will also pay a percentage of your recovered fees to you as a bonus. This is calculated and paid weekly.  \r\n  This position would suit a law graduate, up to 4 year PQE or person returning to the law after a long hiatus. Your starting salary will be negotiated based on your experienced. The nature of our work is that there are plenty of things you can do with little or no skill (following our procedures manual and automated checklists), then as you progress you gradually absorb more and more of the law and a deeper understanding of what you are doing. This allows you to progress onto more complex and challenging work.  \r\n  The wand chooses the wizard and the lawyer chooses the firm\u2026"
